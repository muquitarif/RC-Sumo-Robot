# Arduino code for a remote-controlled car

This repository contains the Arduino code for a remote-controlled car that can be controlled via Bluetooth. The code allows the car to move forward, backward, left and right, based on commands received from a Bluetooth module connected to an Arduino microcontroller. The project uses an Arduino Uno board, a HC-05 Bluetooth module, and a L298N motor driver to control the car's motors. The code is commented and well-organized making it easy to understand and customize as per your requirements.
